## Introduction

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It uses the ID3 decision tree classifier for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv). It contains data on Iris flowers, including features and species labels.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is used to explore the dataset and understand its characteristics. Histograms and count plots are created to visualize the distribution of features and the count of species.

## Relationship between Variables (Attributes)

The project explores the relationships between different attributes of Iris flowers. Scatter plots and a pair plot are used to visualize these relationships. Additionally, a correlation heatmap is created to visualize the correlation between attributes.

## Data Modeling

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to prepare for the modeling process. Features and target labels are defined for the classification model.

## Decision Tree (ID3 Decision Tree Classifier)

The project uses the ID3 decision tree classifier for species classification. The classifier is trained on the training dataset and used to predict the species of Iris flowers in the testing dataset.

## Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the classification model. It provides insights into the accuracy and misclassification of species.

## Prediction of Species

The project allows for the prediction of species for new data points based on the trained decision tree classifier.
